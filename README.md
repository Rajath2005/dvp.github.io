## 📊 Program Documentation & Viva Questions

### 🔢 Program 1: Best Test Average and Palindrome Number

<details>
<summary><b>Working</b></summary>

- Accepts three test marks, removes the lowest score, and calculates the average of the best two.  
- Checks if a number is a palindrome using string reversal.  
- Counts the occurrences of each digit in the number.  

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Viva Questions</b></summary>

**Q1: How does `min()` help in finding the best two scores?**  
> It returns the lowest score, which is subtracted from the total to calculate the best two scores.

**Q2: What happens with non-numeric input?**  
> A `ValueError` is raised, which can be handled using a `try-except` block.

**Q3: Explain `number[::-1]` in palindrome checking.**  
> It uses string slicing with a step of `-1` to reverse the string.

**Q4: How does the digit counting dictionary work?**  
> Iterates through each character, checks if it's a digit, and maintains a count using a dictionary.

</details>

### 🔄 Program 2: Fibonacci and Number Conversions

<details>
<summary><b>Working</b></summary>

- Implements the Fibonacci sequence using recursion: `Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2`.  
- Converts numbers between different bases (binary, octal, hexadecimal).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Viva Questions</b></summary>

**Q1: What are the base cases in Fibonacci recursion?**  
> `n=1` returns `0` and `n=2` returns `1` to avoid infinite recursion.

**Q2: Why use recursion instead of iteration?**  
> Recursion offers a cleaner implementation but is less efficient.

**Q3: Explain base 2 and base 8 conversions.**  
> Use `int(num, 2)` for binary and `int(num, 8)` for octal conversions.

**Q4: How does Python handle hexadecimal conversion?**  
> The `hex()` function converts an integer to a string with a `0x` prefix, using digits `0-9` and `a-f`.
